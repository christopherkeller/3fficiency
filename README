Installing Node:

To run the website, I suggest building a local version of node.  I haven't worked out all of the kinks with a global installation yet.  I followed these instructions:

	git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node
	export JOBS=2 # optional, sets number of parallel commands.
	mkdir ~/local
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/node
	make
	make install
	export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH

Installing npm:
	curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Install dependencies:
	npm install express
	npm install mysql
	npm install ejs
	npm install yaml

node web/nventio.js &
