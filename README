Assumptions:
I connected to ssh with -L3306:localhost:3306, to port forward to the database located on the host.

Installing Node:
To run the website, I suggest building a local version of node.  
I haven't worked out all of the kinks with a global installation yet.  

I followed these instructions:

	git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node
	export JOBS=2 # optional, sets number of parallel commands.
	mkdir ~/local
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/node
	make
	make install
	export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH

Installing npm:
	curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Dependencies:
I have reworked the way we handle dependencies.  There is now a package.json file in the root of the website.  I have moved all of the actual server code to the lib folder.  This seems to be how other people are organizing their code.

The main benefit of this method is that we can enter dependencies into the package.json file and then run `npm bundle` to have to pull down local versions of the dependencies for our application to use.

In theory, you just need to cd into the web directory and then perform npm update && npm bundle commands.
