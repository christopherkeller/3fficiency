Assumptions:
I connected to ssh with -L3306:localhost:3306, to port forward to the database located on the host.

Installing Node:
To run the website, I suggest building a local version of node.  
I haven't worked out all of the kinks with a global installation yet.  

I followed these instructions:

	git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
	cd node
	export JOBS=2 # optional, sets number of parallel commands.
	mkdir ~/local
	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/node
	make
	make install
	export PATH=$HOME/local/node/bin:$PATH

Install dependencies:
	npm install express
	npm install mysql
	npm install ejs
	npm install yaml
	npm install express-csrf
	npm install node_hash

node web/nventio.js &
